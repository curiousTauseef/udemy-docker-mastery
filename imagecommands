Note  :  multiple images of same library can point same image ID
image history

- Get new Image
docker pull ubuntu:18.04

- Look at history of image
docker history ubuntu:14.04

- stop at layers of image it has gone through
docker image inspect nginx

- Change repo name or image name of existing image
docker image tag nginx vijaypawar/nginx  // here vijaypawar/nginx is repo Or image name

- Change tag name of existing image
docker image tag nginx vijaypawar/nginx:testing // here testing is tag name

- Push chanegs to docker hub
docker image push vijaypawar/nginx:development

- Check file where login key is saved 
cat .docker/config.json   // here docker key is saved, so you better logout when done

- Build Image from Dccker file in current folder
docker image build -t yo_image_name . // Dot in end is important

- Build Image from Dccker file in another folder
docker image build -f file_name_from_another_path -t yo_image_name . // -f command

- Keep Least Changing things on top , Frequent On bottom
Eg - Changing url  // Because if u build image 2nd time , it tries to use catche, and if it finds any change on a particular line, then from that line it executes that line instead of using CACHED STUFF
