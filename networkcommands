Shows list of networks
    - docker network ls
    Note  -  it shows Bridge Or Docker network that is created from Bridge Driver

Show details inside network
    - docker network inspect Bridge
    Note - here "Bridge" is network name
            & this command also shows containers attached to that networks

Create networks in docker
    - docker network create my_yo_network

Run and Attach 'New' Mysql container to my_yo_network networks
    - docker container run --name new_mysql --network  my_yo_network mysql

Attach 'Existing' nginx container to my_yo_network networks
    -  docker network disconnect my_yo_network namenginx 

Other Than Container Name
Multiple Containers should to be searched Or called by one DNS Name 
Eg : its like 100's of containers are listening to googles domain Address
you can see that in inspect, everytime you will get data from different ip, thats round robin ip

Below containers have different names but same DNS name
    - docker container run -it -d --network my_yo_network --network-alias searchkar elasticsearch:2   // Here --network-alias 'searchkar' is DNS name
    - docker container run -it -d --network my_yo_network --network-alias searchkar elasticsearch:2   // Here --network-alias 'searchkar' is DNS name
    Test 1 - docker container run --rm --network my_yo_network alpine nslookup searchkar   // Its like curling searchkar from local system
        Server:		127.0.0.11
        Address:	127.0.0.11:53
        Name:	searchkar
        Address: 172.18.0.2
        Name:	searchkar
        Address: 172.18.0.3

    Test 2 - docker container run --rm --network my_yo_network centos curl searchkar:9200  // Its like curling searchkar from centos system
        {"name" : "Living Colossus",
        "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
        "cluster_uuid" : "io-zShfKRN-iIzJ8uxtePA",
        "version" : {
            "number" : "2.4.6",
            "build_hash" : "5376dca9f70f3abef96a77f4bb22720ace8240fd",
            "build_timestamp" : "2017-07-18T12:17:44Z",
            "build_snapshot" : false,
            "lucene_version" : "5.5.4"
        },
        "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"}
        
    Test 3 - docker container run --rm --network my_yo_network centos curl searchkar:9200  // Its like curling searchkar from centos system
        {"name" : "Fateball",
        "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
        "cluster_uuid" : "M_6fmldcQJ239nRzwVYbZQ",
        "version" : {
            "number" : "2.4.6",
            "build_hash" : "5376dca9f70f3abef96a77f4bb22720ace8240fd",
            "build_timestamp" : "2017-07-18T12:17:44Z",
            "build_snapshot" : false,
            "lucene_version" : "5.5.4"
        },
        "tagline" : "You Know, for Search" }
